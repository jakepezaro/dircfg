 implementation
 - use PROMPT_COMMAND & HISTFILE
 - dir config stored in .dircfg file

 - unset -f <function>
 - history -a to write out the history to HISTFILE
 - history -c to clear the history
 - history -r to read HISTFILE into history
  
 
 PROMPT_COMMAND

  - if current history file is different to new file
    - write history to current file
    - set history file to new history file
