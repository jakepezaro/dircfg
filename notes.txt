per directory configuration

for a directory and all it's subdirectories
 - enable a separate history
 - revert to other history when outside
 - source scripts when in a directory or subdirectory
 - remove scripts when out of the directory or subdirectories
 - note that history is and overwrite/revert whereas scripts are append/remove
 
 use cases
 - enter a dir with a .dircfg file
 - enter a subdir without a .dircfg file
 - enter a subdir with a .dircfg file
 - enter a non-subdir without a .dircfg file 
 - enter a non-subdir with a .dircfg file
 
 implementation
 - use PROMPT_COMMAND & HISTFILE
 - dir config stored in .dircfg file
 - DIRCFG env var - /home/jake/d1*/d11/d111*
 - unset -f <function>
 - history -a to write out the history to HISTFILE
 - history -c to clear the history
 - history -r to read HISTFILE into history
  
 
 PROMPT_COMMAND
  - find new history file by looking up directory heirarchy until either
    - root is reached and no .dircfg directories are found -> use default history file
    - use the history file specified in the first (lowest) .dircfg file
  - if current history file is different to new file
    - write history to current file
    - set history file to new history file
    - clear and reload the history
  -
